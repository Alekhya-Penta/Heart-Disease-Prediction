# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains various medical attributes relevant to heart disease diagnosis.

# Dataset
The dataset heart_disease_data.csv includes the following features:

age: Age of the patient
sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (0-3)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
ca: Number of major vessels (0-4) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (0-3)
target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence; 0 = absence)

# Model
The project uses machine learning model Logistic Regression to predict heart disease. Model evaluation is performed using accuracy

# Results
The best performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
